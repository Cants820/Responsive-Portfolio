# responsive-portfolio

#On the 980px break, since the actual length of the screen is around 1000px.Scaling was quite simple. I just went to adjusted the margins of each container.

#On the 768px, I basically did the same thing with the 980px. Except for increasing the width of the Main-Section content so the sidebar (connect with me) section would render underneath main section.

#640px, I increased my header with elements to 100% so there would render as blocks. I also increased the paddings of my main content area and sidebar to fit the width of the screen.
